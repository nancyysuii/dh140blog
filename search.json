    "text": "Introduction\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics, the most anticipated global event of this summer, has brought a renewed focus on the dynamics that shape the world of sports. This project examines the evolution of women’s representation in the Olympics, highlighting the progress made toward gender equality. Additionally, the concept of “home advantage” is analyzed to determine its impact on medal counts for host countries. Finally, this study analyzes the dominance of countries in the Olympics and the sports they excel in, providing insights into the factors contributing to success.\n\nDataset Description\n\n\n\nDataset Name\nDescription\nLink to Resources\n\n\n\n\n120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results\nThis dataset contains detailed information about athletes and their results in the Olympics from 1896 to 2016. It includes variables such as ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight, Team, NOC, Games, Year, Season, City, Sport, Event, and Medal.\nKaggle: 120 Years of Olympic History\n\n\nCountry Wise GDP Data\nThis dataset provides information on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of various countries. It includes variables such as Country, Year, and GDP in USD.\nKaggle: Country GDP Data\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nHow has the representation of women in the Olympics changed over the decades?\nWhat is the impact of home advantage on Olympic medal counts?\nWhich countries have historically dominated which sports in Olympics?\n\n\n\nMotivation\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics, capturing global attention this summer, provides a compelling backdrop for examining the intersection of sports and digital humanities. This project aims to explore the evolving representation of women in sports through digital analysis and assess the impact of home advantage on medal counts. By leveraging digital tools and computational techniques, this research not only highlights the dynamic nature of the Games but also demonstrates how digital humanities can enhance our understanding of socio-economic and cultural phenomena in global sports.\n\n\nMethods\n\nData Preprocessing\n\nImport Data\nCleaning\nMerging\n\nData Analysis\n\nBasic statistical analysis\n\nData Visualization\n\nInsights\nComparsion"
